## AI-Powered Automotive Assistant & Workshop Platform

Cartel Worx Evo2 (KCSS) is an AI-powered automotive assistant and workshop platform. It solves the problem of complex vehicle diagnostics and tuning by translating raw CAN bus data, ECU fault codes, and performance metrics into clear, actionable insights. This makes advanced tuning and diagnostics accessible to both DIY mechanics and professional engineers, while also tying into the Karapiro Cartel brandâ€™s workshop culture.

## Features Overview

*   **ECU Diagnostics**: Translate cryptic fault codes into plain English and get actionable repair advice.
*   **AR Assistant**: Use your phone's camera to overlay real-time data and instructions onto your engine bay.
*   **Data Logging**: Record and analyze performance metrics from your vehicle's sensors.
*   **EV Dashboards**: Monitor your electric vehicle's battery, power consumption, and charging status.
*   **AFR Gauge**: Keep a close eye on your air-fuel ratio for optimal performance and engine health.
*   **PDF Reporting**: Generate professional PDF reports of your diagnostic sessions and tuning changes.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript
*   **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API
*   **Deployment**: Vercel

## Installation and Usage
